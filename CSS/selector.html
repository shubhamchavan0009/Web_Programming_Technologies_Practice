        Use of plastic products such as polythene bags,
        bottles, containers and packing strips etc. is increasing day
        by day creating the disposal problem for the society.
        Attempts are therefore being made to utilize waste plastic
        bottles as geotechnical material to solve both geotechnical
        and environmental problem.
    </div>
    <h2 class="xyz">EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATION</h2>
    <p>This paper presents the results
        of detailed experimental study on the possible use of waste
        plastic bottles as soil reinforcement for bearing capacity
        improvement. Bearing capacity of square footing on sandy
        soil reinforced with waste plastic water bottles is evaluated
        and the effect of parameters like width of reinforcement (L/B
        ratio), number of layers of reinforcement (N) and spacing
        between reinforcing layers is studied through model plate
        load tests.
    </p>

    <b>
        Results show that there is considerable increase in
        bearing capacity value with the provision of plastic bottles as
        reinforcement.
